{"name":"Selude CMS","tagline":"Welcome to Selude CMS, The coolest and easiest MVC framework ever!","body":"If you're here, you've reached the right place to begin your project with the right MVC framework. Read ahead to discover how we have made it easy for you to develop your project with minimum effort of coding.\r\n\r\n# What is Selude?\r\nSelude is derived from 'elude' which means, To escape the understanding or grasp of. Too obvious from it's meaning, Selude tries to provide it's user's a framework where user's can escape the understanding of details of how the underlying process works by providing them components which are obvious and easy  to use.\r\n\r\n# Concept of Selude\r\nSelude is a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, which means, it deals with three components, Model, View and Controller. Moreover, it is not restricted to just MVC. In fact, Selude is inspired by concepts of Android OS where any component of any App can be invoked by another app just by specifying permissions without having the complete app to be initialized.\r\nMapping these concepts to Selude, a web application or a website is seen in terms of Pages (such as Profile page, settings page, or wall on Facebook) and Views (Edit profile view on profile page; accounts settings, privacy settings page on Facebook). Each of these views from any page can contain any view from any other page. And this, my friend, is, what we call, the easiest and coolest thing of Selude! You just define the views from self (same page) or foreign pages (views from other pages in same project) in the layout definition of the view and when you would call the view, all the views will be rendered collectively into a beautifully arrange HTML code. Please note that to include a view in another view, you have to firstly define the definitions of all those views in same pages layout (for views from self) or foreign page's layout (for views from other pages).\r\n\r\n# Detailing the concept\r\nSuppose you have a project at domain `www.example.com` and you visit a page at `example.com/user/profile` So in this URL, `user` is the page you're viewing and 'profile' is the view that is actually being shown. In a similar way, 'user' page can have 'settings' view, 'dashboard' view, etc. Anything passed beyond it is considered the data part. So, a URL referring to `www.example.com/user/profile/tab/account/edit/true` gives page as `user`, view as `profile` and rest of the parameters as data part in `'key'=>'value'` pair, eg., `'tab'=>'account'`, `'edit'=>'true'`, which you can access using `$this->_get(\"tab\")` (in controllers) or `sRequest::_get(\"tab\")` in view components.\r\nThis seems pretty simple as long as you have simple page views and lesser complicated pages but as the complexity goes on increasing, the view URL may go on increasing in length with large data passed. Also, this is not SEO friendly. That's where URL rewriting comes in!\r\nSELUDE's URL rewrite approach emphasizes on dynamic URL rewriting, which means they're not saved in database, unlike other CMS. Rather, they are stored in a global array named as `'$router'` which can be found at `config/router.php`. Rewrited URLs can be assigned to links (anchor tags) using `App::_route('original_url, eg., user/profile/edit/true')` which may return `user/1`. See, how shortened is the new URL!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
