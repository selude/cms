Read ahead to discover how we have made it easy for you to develop your project with minimum effort of coding.\r\n\r\n# What is Selude?\r\nSelude is derived from 'elude' which means, To escape the understanding or grasp of. Too obvious from it's meaning, Selude tries to provide it's user's a framework where user's can escape the understanding of details of how the underlying process works by providing them components which are obvious and easy  to use.\r\n\r\n# Concept of Selude\r\nSelude is a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, which means, it deals with three components, Model, View and Controller. Moreover, it is not restricted to just MVC. In fact, Selude is inspired by concepts of Android OS where any component of any App can be invoked by another app just by specifying permissions without having the complete app to be initialized.\r\nMapping these concepts to Selude, a web application or a website is seen in terms of Pages (such as Profile page, settings page, or wall on Facebook) and Views (Edit profile view on profile page; accounts settings, privacy settings page on Facebook). Each of these views from any page can contain any view from any other page. And this, my friend, is, what we call, the easiest and coolest thing of Selude! You just define the views from self (same page) or foreign pages (views from other pages in same project) in the layout definition of the view and when you would call the view, all the views will be rendered collectively into a beautifully arrange HTML code. Please note that to include a view in another view, you have to firstly define the definitions of all those views in same pages layout (for views from self) or foreign page's layout (for views from other pages)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
